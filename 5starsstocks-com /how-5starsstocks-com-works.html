  <h2 id="intro">Introduction to the Five-Star Rating</h2>
  <p>The five-star rating system is the core of 5StarsStocks.com. Instead of overwhelming users with raw financial data, it condenses stock potential into a simple visual score from 1 to 5 stars. This approach is particularly helpful for beginner investors who want quick, digestible insights.</p>

  <h2 id="factors">Main Factors Considered in Ratings</h2>
  <p>While 5StarsStocks does not disclose its exact formula, common factors likely influencing its ratings include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fundamental strength:</strong> Earnings growth, debt ratios, and revenue stability</li>
    <li><strong>Valuation metrics:</strong> Price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-book (P/B), and PEG ratios</li>
    <li><strong>Technical indicators:</strong> Moving averages, RSI, MACD trends</li>
    <li><strong>Market sentiment:</strong> News coverage, analyst recommendations, and trading volume</li>
    <li><strong>Sector trends:</strong> How the stock’s industry is performing overall</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="scoring">How the Scoring System Works</h2>
  <p>The system appears to assign scores to each factor, then average or weight them to produce a final star rating. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Excellent across all factors → 5 stars</li>
    <li>Strong fundamentals but weak momentum → 3–4 stars</li>
    <li>Poor fundamentals and technicals → 1–2 stars</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This weighted approach ensures that a single bad metric doesn’t automatically ruin the overall rating, but consistently poor performance will drag it down.</p>

  <h2 id="star-meaning">What Each Star Rating Means</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5 Stars:</strong> Very strong potential based on current data</li>
    <li><strong>4 Stars:</strong> Good investment candidate with minor risks</li>
    <li><strong>3 Stars:</strong> Moderate potential; proceed with caution</li>
    <li><strong>2 Stars:</strong> Weak potential; high risk</li>
    <li><strong>1 Star:</strong> Poor outlook; avoid unless speculative</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
  <p>While the ratings can be a useful filter, they are not perfect. Market conditions can change quickly, and the model’s algorithm cannot predict black swan events or sudden sector downturns. Treat the ratings as a starting point, not as guaranteed investment advice.</p>

  <h2 id="tips">Tips for Using the Ratings Effectively</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-check high-rated stocks with other analysis tools</li>
    <li>Track rating changes over time to spot trends</li>
    <li>Combine star ratings with your personal risk tolerance</li>
    <li>Don’t invest solely based on stars — research the company</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>The 5StarsStocks.com five-star rating system simplifies stock selection, making it easier for beginners to navigate the market. However, investors should remember that no rating system can replace comprehensive research. Use it as a guide, not a rulebook, and always keep your investment goals in mind.</p>
