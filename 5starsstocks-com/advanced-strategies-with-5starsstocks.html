  <h2 id="what-data">What data feeds into the ratings?</h2>
  <p>Stock-rating platforms like 5StarsStocks generally combine multiple public and proprietary data sources. Typical inputs include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fundamental data:</strong> revenue, earnings, profit margins, debt levels, cash flow, and growth rates from company filings and financial APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>Valuation metrics:</strong> P/E, P/B, PEG, EV/EBITDA and other relative valuation measures.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> price history, moving averages, momentum indicators (RSI, MACD), and volume patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Market & sector signals:</strong> sector performance, relative strength versus peers, and macro indicators.</li>
    <li><strong>News & sentiment:</strong> headlines, press releases, and sometimes social media sentiment scores.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note:</em> Platforms may also enrich these with proprietary adjustments or third-party data feeds — the exact list is rarely published in full.</p>

  <h2 id="scoring-model">How the scoring model typically works</h2>
  <p>Although 5StarsStocks does not publish its exact formula publicly, most rating engines follow a multi-step process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Normalize inputs:</strong> Convert different metrics (growth %, P/E, RSI, etc.) to a common scale so they can be compared.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply weights:</strong> Assign relative importance to each factor (for example, fundamentals might be weighted higher for long-term scores, technicals higher for short-term).</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregate sub-scores:</strong> Combine weighted factor scores into category scores (fundamentals, valuation, technicals, sentiment).</li>
    <li><strong>Compute final score:</strong> Average or use a weighted sum of category scores and map the result to a star scale (1–5).</li>
    <li><strong>Post-processing:</strong> Rules may adjust scores for outliers, new corporate actions (earnings, splits), or risk filters.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="ai-or-rules">Is it real AI or rule-based scoring?</h2>
  <p>Many platforms claim “AI-powered” ratings. In practice, there are two common approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rule-based scoring:</strong> Deterministic rules and weighted formulas. Easier to audit and explain; common for star systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine learning / AI:</strong> Models trained on historical outcomes to predict future performance. These can include feature engineering and model ensembles.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Available public commentary and reviews suggest 5StarsStocks may use a hybrid approach: automated algorithms with rule-based business logic. That means users should treat “AI” claims with healthy skepticism and look for empirical results.</p>

  <h2 id="update-frequency">How often ratings are updated</h2>
  <p>Update cadence depends on the data feeding the system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time or intraday:</strong> For price-driven technical signals and alerts.</li>
    <li><strong>Daily:</strong> When using end-of-day data and news aggregation.</li>
    <li><strong>Event-driven:</strong> After earnings releases, guidance changes, or major corporate events.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you rely on ratings for trading, prefer platforms that clearly state their update frequency and whether alerts are pushed instantly.</p>

  <h2 id="transparency">Transparency & limitations</h2>
  <p>Key transparency issues to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proprietary formulas:</strong> Companies often protect their exact weights and thresholds as intellectual property.</li>
    <li><strong>Backtesting bias:</strong> Historical backtests may be optimized for past data and not indicative of future returns.</li>
    <li><strong>Data quality:</strong> Incorrect or delayed data feeds (e.g., stale financials) can skew scores.</li>
    <li><strong>Model blind spots:</strong> No model predicts black swan events; ratings do not replace fundamental due diligence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="verify">How you can verify a rating</h2>
  <p>Practical ways to validate or cross-check a star rating:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Compare across platforms:</strong> Check the same stock on TradingView, Finviz, Screener.in, or your broker’s research.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspect fundamentals:</strong> Look at latest earnings, revenue trend, and debt levels in the company’s filings.</li>
    <li><strong>Check news & filings:</strong> Confirm there are no recent events (earnings misses, restatements) that would change the view.</li>
    <li><strong>Backtest manually:</strong> If possible, test how the platform’s top-rated picks performed historically over different market cycles.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="practical-use">Practical workflow for users</h2>
  <p>Here’s a simple, safe workflow to use ratings as part of a broader strategy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use star ratings to build a short list of candidates (filter for 4–5 stars).</li>
    <li>Run quick fundamental checks (revenue, EPS trend, debt).</li>
    <li>Look at the chart and volume to confirm technical health.</li>
    <li>Verify any recent news that could affect the outlook.</li>
    <li>Decide position size and set stop-loss based on risk tolerance.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="final">Final takeaways</h2>
  <p>5StarsStocks’ star system is a convenient way to condense many data points into an easy-to-digest score. However, the system likely blends automated algorithms with heuristic rules and uses a mix of fundamentals, technicals, and sentiment data. Because the exact formula is proprietary, always treat star ratings as <em>one</em> input among many. Use cross-checks, verify sources, and combine ratings with your own investment plan for safer, more informed decisions.</p>
